IncludeOrph is a program conducted in Sri Lanka to enhance IT education in children in Orphanages.

Project 1:

Thummodara Methodist Girls’ Home, a girls’ orphanage situated in a rural area is one such ‘home’, managed by the Methodist Church in Sri Lanka. It has been a home for orphan girls for over 85 years! This girls’ orphanage provide rural orphan girls with the basic needs and the protection until they reach the age of 18. They are being sent to school for education but it is clear that like any other fund driven non-profit organization, additional tuition costs for additional learning cannot be provided since that money could contribute to basic needs of another orphan girl child. Therefore these girls in the orphanage, tend to lack basic computation knowledge due to lack of resources and mentorship. We provide resources and mentorship through a series of sessions conducted in a period of six months.

The aim of this project is to guide orphan girls in the path towards equalizing women and men in technical industry and to inspire, motivate and move more of them living in diversified environments to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). 

Co-founders of this program are Nathalie Fernando and Dilushi Piumwardane.

The resources for this project is partially funded by Anita Borg Institute.
